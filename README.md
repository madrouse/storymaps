# storymaps

My favorite aspect of cartography is storytelling. I love taking complex geospatial data and distilling it into the "So what?" for a general audience. I am highly skilled in science communication, and my preferred tools are ArcGIS StoryMaps and ArcGIS Dashboards.

These story maps showcase my ability to put geospatial data into the hands of non-technical decision-makers in a way that is accessible, factual, and carto-focused.

This story map was created for the 30 Day Map Challenge for Day 4: A Bad Map. Based on discourse in the carto community about the exclusive nature of making maps with poor design choices and calling them “bad,” I went in a different direction.

This comedic story map gives some... questionable... first-date advice for Seattleites.
